# Texture-Haven

This repo contains the website code for [Texture Haven](https://texturehaven.com/).

I am not a web developer really, so I appologize in advance for the hideous code you are about to see.

Contributions in the form of pull requests, bug reports or simply ideas are welcome.

You will not be able to build the site locally as it requires some database login info,
however it is fairly straight forward PHP for the most part and should be intuitive.
